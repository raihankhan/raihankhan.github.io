Also, directories are called folders as they can be assumed of as folders where files reside in the form of a physical desktop analogy. Directories can be organized in a tree-like hierarchy in Linux and several other operating systems.\nThe directory structure of Linux is well-documented and defined in the Linux FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard). Referencing those directories if accessing them is achieved via the sequentially deeper names of the directory linked by \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; forward slash like /var/spool/mail and /var/log. These are known as paths.\nThe below table gives a very short standard, defined, and well-known top-level Linux directory list and their purposes:\n/ (root filesystem): It is the top-level filesystem directory. It must include every file needed to boot the Linux system before another filesystem is mounted. Every other filesystem is mounted on a well-defined and standard mount point because of the root filesystem directories after the system is started.\n/boot: It includes the static kernel and bootloader configuration and executable files needed to start a Linux computer.\n/bin: This directory includes user executable files.\n/dev: It includes the device file for all hardware devices connected to the system. These aren\u0026rsquo;t device drivers; instead, they are files that indicate all devices on the system and provide access to these devices.\n/etc: It includes the local system configuration files for the host system.\n/lib: It includes shared library files that are needed to start the system.\n/home: The home directory storage is available for user files. All users have a subdirectory inside /home.\n/mnt: It is a temporary mount point for basic filesystems that can be used at the time when the administrator is working or repairing a filesystem.\n/media: A place for mounting external removable media devices like USB thumb drives that might be linked to the host.\n/opt: It contains optional files like vendor supplied application programs that must be placed here.\n/root: It\u0026rsquo;s the home directory for a root user. Keep in mind that it\u0026rsquo;s not the \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; (root) file system.\n/tmp: It is a temporary directory used by the OS and several programs for storing temporary files. Also, users may temporarily store files here. Remember that files may be removed without prior notice at any time in this directory.\n/sbin: These are system binary files. They are executables utilized for system administration.\n/usr: They are read-only and shareable files, including executable libraries and binaries, man files, and several documentation types.\n/var: Here, variable data files are saved.

Our task is to compute the distance by which the center of the rod is displaced. The problem could be easily visualized with the given picture in the problem statement. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume the straight rod AB is placed inside a circle and the arch shaped rod AB arch is on the perimeter of this circle. We can visualize it like this -\nHere h+c is the diameter of the circle. our aim is to find this h. This line have intersected our original rod shape line AB at the centre and so we can say that L = 2a or a = L/2. Now, from the Intersecting Cord Theorem we get -\nLet D be the diameter of this circle and r be the radius. Hence,\nDeviding D by 2 we get the radius\nLet\u0026rsquo;s find out theta as shown in the circle. As theta is an angle in a parpendicular triangle and we know value of two of the sides r and a, we can easily calculate it.\nNow lets\u0026rsquo;s see - we have radius of the circle r, we have an angle theta, if we double theta we get the angle for arch AB. So, we can calculate the arch length using formula. At first we will calculate L\u0026rsquo; as given in the problem statement.\nWe can now apply binary search/bisection method using h as a key or mid value, lower bound as 0 and higher bound as L/2 (as it is said- Input data guarantee that no rod expands by more than one-half of its original length, so h must be smaller than L/2). For each corresponding value of h, S will be determined and compared to L\u0026rsquo;. If S is greater that L\u0026rsquo; that means we need to lower the value of h. If S is lesser that L\u0026rsquo; that means we need to increase the value of h. After some careful iteration we will get our required value of h within O(log2(L/2)) complexity for each testcase.\nSource Code #include\u0026lt;bits/stdc++.h\u0026gt; #define EPS 1e-7 using namespace std; int main() { int T; double L,n,C; cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; T; for(int t=1;t\u0026lt;=T;t++) { cin \u0026gt;\u0026gt; L \u0026gt;\u0026gt; n \u0026gt;\u0026gt; C; double L_prime = (1.0+n*C)*L; double a = L/2.0,s=L_prime; double h,r,theta,temp_s,low=0,high=L/2.0; while(high-low\u0026gt;EPS) { h = (low+high)/2.0; r = ((L*L)/(8.0*h)) + (h/2.0); theta = 2.0*asin(a/r); temp_s = r*theta; if(temp_s\u0026gt;=s) high=h; else low=h; } cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;Case \u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; t \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;: \u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; setprecision(7) \u0026lt;\u0026lt; fixed \u0026lt;\u0026lt; low \u0026lt;\u0026lt; endl; } return 0; } ","date":"March 8, 2023","hero":"/posts/problem-discussion/lightoj/1137/images/hero.jpg","permalink":"https://raihankhan.github.io/posts/problem-discussion/lightoj/1137/","summary":"Problem statement Here we are given a solid rod of length L that expands to length L\u0026rsquo; and creates an arch shape with the original shape of the rod.
